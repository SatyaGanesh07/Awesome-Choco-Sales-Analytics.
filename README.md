## Sample DAX Calculations

```DAX
-- Total Shipments
Total Shipments = COUNTROWS(shipments)

-- Total Sales (Latest Month)
Total Sales Latest Month =
VAR ld = [latest date]
RETURN CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'calendar'[Start of Month] = ld)

-- Month-over-Month Sales Change %
latest MoM Sales Change % =
VAR ld = [latest date]
VAR this_month_sales = [Total Sales Latest Month]
VAR prev_month_sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'calendar'[Start of Month] = EDATE(ld, -1))
RETURN DIVIDE(this_month_sales - prev_month_sales, prev_month_sales)
```
